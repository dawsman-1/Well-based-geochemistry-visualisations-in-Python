# Well based geochemistry visualisations in Python
Visualisation of various geochemical data types acquired from petroleum exploration wells, in context of other well data (e.g. petrophysical logs, drilling parameters etc.)

The raw data used includes petrophysical logs, mudgas and drilling parameters, and mudgas isotope analysis (from Isotubes).

All data is open-file and publicly available, and was downloaded from https://nopims.dmp.wa.gov.au/nopims
