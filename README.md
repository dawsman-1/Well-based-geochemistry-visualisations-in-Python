# Well based geochemistry visualisations in Python
Visualisation of various geochemical data types acquired from petroleum exploration wells, in context of other well data (e.g. petrophysical logs, drilling parameters etc.)

Plots have been created using the Plotly library, and are interactive (hover labels, zoom in/out etc.)

All raw data used is open-file and publicly available, and was downloaded from https://nopims.dmp.wa.gov.au/nopims

Interactive visualisation examples can be seen here: https://dawsman-1.github.io/Well-based-geochemistry-visualisations-in-Python/
